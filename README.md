##### 👋 About Me

I am a mechanical engineer focused on CNC machine design, CAD/CAM workflows, and manufacturing-oriented software.  
I work with both industrial engineering tools and open-source ecosystems, aiming to bridge practical manufacturing needs with flexible, transparent software solutions.

My main interests include:
- Multi-axis CNC machine kinematics
- CAD/CAM integration
- Geometry kernels and computational geometry
- Manufacturing automation and simulation

##### 🎯 Philosophy

I believe engineering software should be:
- Technically correct
- Manufacturing-oriented
- Well-documented
- As open and transparent as possible

##### Quick Start — Suggested Repo Structure

Organize projects and experiments consistently to make them easier to reuse and contribute to:

- `/docs` — Design notes, tutorials, and documentation
- `/examples` — Small reproducible demos and minimal examples
- `/posts` — LinuxCNC configs, post-processors, and machine files
- `/sim` — Kinematics simulations and test harnesses
- `/src` — Larger code projects (C++, Python, etc.)
- `/data` — Example CAD files, test datasets

Example README sections for a project:
- How to build (dependencies, commands)
- How to run (examples and expected outputs)
- Tests & verification
- License & contribution guidelines

---

##### Contributing

Contributions, issues, and suggestions are welcome.

If you want to collaborate:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (e.g. `feature/kinematics-demo`)
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of changes and how to test them

Please include:
- Build/run instructions
- Example inputs and expected outputs
- Any test cases used for validation
